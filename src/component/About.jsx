        <p>
          I arrived in the United States in 1999 just in time for the 996. As a
          child, the 911 caught my eye and ignited my passion for all things
          Porsche. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br> 
          Ever since then, my love my cars exploded and I became
          obsessed with everythjing automotive. I love all cars, but the 996 has
          a special place in my heart. It was deemed a “boy’s toy” and I was
          told I would grow out of it. I never did.I have owned 3 996s and
          currently own a 2002 996 C4. I have been a member of the Porsche Club
          of America since 2001 and had the pleasure of meeting many Porsche
          enthusiasts.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> In doing so, I encountered a problem: Finding cars was
          difficult. Getting pricing and comps was even harder. Not to mention
          the lack of transparency! We decided to solve some of these problems
          through technology (our other passion) and made it available to
          friends and family – they loved it!
          <br></br>
