        <p>
          I arrived in the United States in 1999, just in time for the release
          of the 996. As a child, the 911 immediately caught my attention and
          sparked my passion for everything Porsche. Since then, my love for
          cars has grown exponentially, and I've become obsessed with everything
          automotive. While I appreciate all car models, the 996 holds a special
          place in my heart. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite being labeled as a "boy's toy" and being
          told that I would eventually outgrow it, my fascination with the 996
          never waned. In fact, I have owned three 996s over the years, and I
          currently own a 2002 996 C4. Additionally, I have been an active
          member of the Porsche Club of America since 2001, where I have had the
          pleasure of connecting with numerous Porsche enthusiasts. During my
          interactions with fellow enthusiasts, I encountered a significant
          challenge: finding available cars proved to be a difficult task.

          Furthermore, obtaining accurate pricing information and comparisons
          was even more challenging. The lack of transparency within the market
          added to the frustration. To address these issues, we decided to
          leverage our passion for technology and develop a solution.
